//currEnd is the edge of your current leap â€” once you're there, time to jump again.
//farthest is looking ahead and saying, "I can reach that far next if I jump from the best possible stone in my current leap range."
//This greedy approach ensures minimal jumps because we always extend our range as far as possible before jumping
